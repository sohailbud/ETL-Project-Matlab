# ETL-Project-Matlab

These files represent functions written by me to perform ETL process in Matlab while working at my current job. I have tried writing the code in such a fashion to minimize redundancy and achieve consistency over multiple projects of similar nature. 

In this particular project, where we received the data in CSVs, the functions are designed to perform following tasks:

* Import the data in Matlab
* Filter out information required for the current project
* Transform various demographics to DMA level by using mapping files
* Create a consistent index across all datasets
* Balance the data by providing missing entries
* Check for outliers
* Perform calculations on various variables to achieve desired results to be included in the model
